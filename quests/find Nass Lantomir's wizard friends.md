Wizard 1: [[Nass Lantomir]] is looking for a wizard older woman with a snowy owl and an eye patch. This wizard has an item on her that she thinks was [[Nass Lantomir]]'s. We should try to recover this item that looks a fancy orb.

Wizard 2: There is another wizard in the [[Ten Towns]] who likes to travel with some undead creature. Likely called a [[wight]]. 

Wizard 3: The last associate is a tiefling with a black raven. Likely is the trainer of [[Bael]]. Likely named [[Avarice]]. Confirmed that it is [[Avarice]].

They are looking for [[Netherese]] artifacts.

We find the first wizard in [[Termalaine]] in the [[Blue Clam Tavern]]. She has an orb called [[Professor Skant]]. A professor orb is kind of like Jarvis. She pulls it out of the orb. Her name is [[Vellen Harpelle]]. We ask about [[Avarice]] and the last sighting was that she went east with [[Dazzan]]. 

The orb knows of [[Netherese]] things but doesn't know where the city is. [[Professor Skant]] thinks that the city is called [[Yetherin]] which is said to have crashed in the north. The [[Netherese]] were famous for living in floating cities.

[[Vellen Harpelle]] needs bodies to "bolster her ranks". We suggest killing all of the [[kobold]]s in the mine and using mine carts to transport the bodies. We clear out the mine and deliver a body of a tentacled monster to [[Vellen Harpelle]].

We meet [[Avarice]] and show her the [[Netherese]] partial song music sheet. She says she could use it to triangulate the direction of the [[Netherese]]. She uses the music sheet to triangulate the [[Netherese]] city.

We find that [[Dazzan]] is slotted to be publicly executed. We reach the town and see that [[Dazzan]] burned at the stake by [[Captain Imdra Arlaggath]]. We think that he was wrongfully accused and killed.

We learn that [[Dazzan]] said he found a strange structure in the ice. It sounds like it might have been [[Netherese]]. He apparently came back with some people who he'd paid to go out into the tundra where he found a tower buried halfway into the snow.
