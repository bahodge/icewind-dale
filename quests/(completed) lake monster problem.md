In [[Bremen]] there is some kind of monster/creature that has all of the fishermen scared. Fishing production has come to a crawl. It is bad for the town, people and the lake. We should take care of this creature. The people of [[Bremen]] can speak more thoroughly about this creature.

We hear a rumor from [[Keagan Velaran]] about monster that lives in [[Maer Dualdon]] but only [[Bremen]] is being terrorized and not the rest of the towns in the area.

We arrive at the town of [[Bremen]] and are pointed to the head fisherman, [[Grenski Barrelbore]]. We go to the docks to meet [[Grenski Barrelbore]]. We speak with him and he points us in the right direction.

We meet [[Talli]] who requests that we don't kill the monster. We ask the monster to stop scaring the fishermen. A human gave the monster the gift of speech named [[Ravison]] and that they must do their part to help the frost maiden.

[[Skam]] puts a protective spell (bullshit) to help the monster retain his intelligence. We name him [[Wet BJ]]. We need to go back to [[Targos]] and turn in our quest to [[Tharnel Maxandriar]].
