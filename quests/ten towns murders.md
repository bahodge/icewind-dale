We speak with [[Sheriff Markham Southwell]] and he offers a reward of 100gp for bringing the murderer to justice. We need evidence and dead or alive is fine. 

[[Hlen Trollbane]] reported that the first murder was in [[Easthaven]]. The body was in the street. There was an icy dagger piercing their heart with a single set of foot prints surrounding it. The victim was a halfing trapper named the [[Benemeni Trapper]]. They were a scrimshaw. Person who carves on bones and stuff.

The second murder was in [[Bryn Shander]] and the only thing linking them was another icy dagger stabbed through their heart. They were a dwarf glassblower. They have family in [[Bryn Shander]]. Her name was [[Hourgrare Glassblow]].

The icy daggers were probably made by frost druids. They demanded sacrifices to [[Auril]]. There have been no recent sightings in the east. [[Hlen Trollbane]] tells us that there is a connection and conspiracy afoot. We suspect that the next murder will happen in [[Targos]].

We sign a contract with [[Hlen Trollbane]] to split the reward 5 ways and she agrees to share more details about the murders. We learn that [[Ten Towns]] are sacrificing humans in order to appease [[Auril]] and citizens are trying to bribe their way out of the lottery.

We go to the [[Luskin Arms]] in search of [[Tharnel Maxandriar]], the speaker of [[Targos]]. We learn that [[Tharnel Maxandriar]] chased the frost druids out of town and refused to sacrifice their people. We suspect that the speaker is the target.

[[Skam]] come up with the idea to check the logbooks in each town to see who was in town at time of the murder. We learn from [[Sergeant Hathlen Arkora]] that someone was murdered in [[Termalaine]] with an ice dagger. We noticed that [[Torgs Caravan]] has been in all the cities during each of the murders. We learn that [[Torgs Caravan]] left only shortly after the murder in [[Termalaine]]. The caravan left with [[Garrett Veloran]] and an expedition headed to [[Kelvin's Caern]]. We also notice that the murders were happening every 14 days. We likely have approximately 10 days.

There was another murder in [[Caer Dineval]] where a local fisherman was found dead with an ice knife in him.

We speak with [[Avarice]] and she thinks that [[Arastra Roh]] might have been blessed by the frost druids.
