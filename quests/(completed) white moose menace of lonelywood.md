A large white moose is menacing around [[Lonelywood]]. There is a competition in the town to deal with the moose. We should speak with speaker [[Nimsy Huddle]]. We learn that the moose is disrupting logging and killing people. There is a banshee somewhere in the forest.

Where are the moose' hunting grounds? It always attacks the loggers. About the same time the moose attacked there was a banshee.

As we walk through the woods and we find 2 small creatures. They are moving around a pine cone. We identify them as [[chawinga]]s. They are pulling the pine cone apart. One of them has a fork another has a knife. [[Murdoch]] helps them by cutting the pine cone for them. The [[chawinga]]s are happy. They grant him a charm of heroism.

We talk to the [[banshee]] and head north to help her cleanse her tomb. We find some moose tracks. We arrive at a tomb.

We are attacked by the bloody white moose.

We kill the shit out of the moose.

We solve a braiser puzzle and ressurect a mummy. The mummy is named [[Sah'nar]]. We try to convince her to use moon magic to cast a moonbeam and open the tomb of the [[banshee]]. She blesses [[Skam]]'s flute and gives him a [[wooden cup with etched fish]].
