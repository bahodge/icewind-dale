We agree to buy a treasure map in exchange for 10% and 8gp from a scraggly old man in the [[North Look Inn]]. The X on the map points to the town [[Bremen]]. The name of the old man is [[Jameski]].

We walk into the inn and a woman sees our map and calls it a flyer. Meaning that we got scammed. We lost the coupon attached to the bottom of the flyer.

New objective: Kill [[Jameski]] for scamming us.
