 The speaker there has been negligent and allowing the town to go to rot. The speaker named [[Speaker Orus]] is a nepo baby. We should speak with [[Sergeant Hathlen Arkora]] and see if we can help him take power in [[Termalaine]]. We start the quest [[(completed) get the sergeant elected to power in Termalaine]].

We speak with [[Sergeant Hathlen Arkora]], and he tells us that the mine is not in the town and therefore isn't covered by the militia. He is happy to take credit for clearing the mines. They asked speaker [[Oarus]] to fund the defense of the mine but there was not enough money to cover it.
