We begin at the outside of the [[Netherese]] tower. Both [[Vellen Harpelle]] and [[Avarice]] refuse to let the other in. We put on our crampons and move down the tunnel. We slide down the tunnel and emerge into a room.

We climb through a door that is ajar. and enter a hallway. We open a door and are attacked by some strong [[bugbear]]s. We almost die and have to call for help from [[Avarice]] who absolutely murders all the [[bugbear]]s. [[Bael]] is thrown down a hole but gracefully lands.

We find some books
1. Mysteries of the Phaerimm
2. Wizards in the Hollow
3. [[Magical Wonders of Netheril]]

The [[Magical Wonders of Netheril]] book contains a description of [[Mythalar]] which were magical items used to control the weather. The [[Netherese]] were the creators of them.

[[Avarice]] doesn't know elvish.

We are able to find a chest and get some potions from it. All of the potions look similar in viscocity.
1. potion of acid resistance
2. potion of cold resistance
3. potion of fire resistance
4. potion of force resistance

We find a few more books
1. Ajamarâ€™s Guide to the Phantastic
2. The Unfettered Mind

We continue to explore the inverted tower. An eight pointed star is attached to an alter. We recognize the symbol as the symbol of [[Mystral]], the god of magic. We touch the symbol and a stoppered flask with luminous blue liquid.

We open a door and find [[Dazzan]]. Or at least a simulacrum of [[Dazzan]]. [[Krintass]] protects [[Dazzan]]'s simulacrum. There is an [[amulet of the shield guardian]], amulet of a [[shield guardian]] on the desk and it is our reward for helping [[Dazzan]].

![[amulet_of_the_shield_guardian.png]]

We agree to help [[Dazzan]]'s simulacrum come back to life. He tells us that there is a [[basilisk]] in the tower that is guarding the machine. In the room there are many books.

1. Lost Scrolls of Sabreyl
2. From Shadow, Substance 
	1. speculative findings of turning illusions into reality
3. Here Lies the King
	1. a prince who used illusionist skills to replace a king.
4. Ventatost
	1. netherese city that went missing

We find a human skeleton in tattered robes, the remains of an apprentice who died in the crash. We are able to finish a scroll of mending and decide to head down the hole and are attacked by a [[basilisk]]. [[Bael]] is petrified while fighting the [[basilisk]]. [[Murdoch]] and [[Worthy]] kill it and continue exploring. As they explore they find the room where we could revive [[Dazzan]].

[[Dazzan]] tells us that the city is somewhere to the east under an iceberg. The [[Arcane Brotherhood]] is going to camp out at the tower. [[Dazzan]] informs the rest of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] of the possible location of the city. We need a weapon or magic to get through the ice to get to the city. [[Vellen Harpelle]] tells us that we might have some luck if we speak with followers of [[Auril]].
