[[Murdoch]] has spent the last day looking for someone. He found out that many of the fishermen in the area selling all of their assets and another group called the [[Obsidian Holdings]]. It sounds suspicious.

We all meet up in [[Bremen]]. [[Talli]] the scientist agrees to join us and return to [[Targos]]. We go to the [[Buried Treasures Inn]] and we ask about the land being sold. [[Skam]] analyses a fisherman's contract that clearly shows they sold the land for under value. We go to the [[Bremen]] town hall in search of information on the [[Obsidian Holdings]]. They do not have any evidence in the town hall.

We leave [[Bremen]] and go to [[Targos]]. We go to the town hall in search of speaker [[Speaker Tharnel Maxandriar|T]]. We inform her that the [[(completed) lake monster problem]] has been taken care of.

We receive the reward for completing the lake monster problem. Speaker [[Speaker Tharnel Maxandriar]] says we should go to [[Termalaine]] and solve all the problems there. 

We start the [[(completed) get the sergeant elected to power in Termalaine]] quest. We let it slip that we have a fancy gem and he seems very interested. We ask spekaer [[Speaker Tharnel Maxandriar]] about the [[Obsidian Holdings]]. He says that he doesn't really deal with that.

We prepare to set off to [[Termalaine]] by buying some rations and some fishing gear. We head out to [[Termalaine]]. We arrive on the outskirts of the town and it is very pretty. It looks very fancy. We hear a town crier the gemstone mine is closed because of monsters and speaker [[Mashew]] is offering 50gp to clear the mine. Speaker [[Mashew]] and [[Sergeant Hathlen Arkora]] would likely be at town hall during the day. They might be at [[Blue Clam Tavern]] or [[East Side Inn]]. The [[Termalaine Mine]] is about 30 minutes up the hill.

We go to the [[Blue Clam Tavern]] and see one of the wizards that [[Nass Lantomir]] mentioned as part of the [[find Nass Lantomir's wizard friends]] quest. We also find [[Sergeant Hathlen Arkora]] and speak with him about clearing out the mine. We learn that the town of [[Termalaine]] sacrifices villagers for the frost druids.

We go to the [[East Side Inn]] and spend the night.

The next morning we wake up and head towards the [[Termalaine Mine]] first light. The trip to the mine takes 30 minutes. As we approach the mine we see a open tunnel on a hillside next to a sign saying it belongs to kobolds.

We clear out the [[Termalaine Mine]] and speak with [[Sergeant Hathlen Arkora]]. We speak with [[Vellen Harpelle]] and learn more about [[Skam]]'s music sheet.

The town of [[Termalaine]] holds a vote and the town elects the [[Sergeant Hathlen Arkora]] as the speaker of the town. We complete the [[(completed) get the sergeant elected to power in Termalaine]] quest.

Next Time:
- go to [[Lonelywood]].
