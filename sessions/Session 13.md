The party awakes in [[Goodmead]]. There is a commotion in the street and we hear a person. [[Bael]] calls out and sees [[Caska Lane]] who is suffering from the same thing.

[[Arceus]]' dogs name is [[Nike]]. [[Bael]]'s dog's name is [[Anchovie]]

We decide that we will travel with them to the [[Spine of the World]].  We learn that the meteor landed across the [[Redwaters]]. [[Butter]] the goat was sent to the [[White Moose Inn]]. [[Faef]] tells us where to go. We decide to not go over the lake, instead we decide to cross on the southern side. [[Bael]] is drawn to the meteor and helps the party find the crash site.

Ahead of the group, [[Worthy]] sees a some strange worm/reptiles rooting in the snow. She recognizes the creatures as [[carrion crawler]]s. They begin charging at the party but [[Bael]] orders them to stop and lead the party to the ship. They obey because of the [[psi crystal]].

The ship comes into view

A massive dorsal fin lunges through the snow and the party enters initiative. It errupts from the snow.
![[bulette.png]]
The [[bulette]] fucks up the party quite a lot. We kill the [[bulette]] and continue on to the ship wreck.

We approach the shipwreck and see a squid gnome named [[Dredovex]]
![[dredovex.png]]
We approach the lower sphincter and enter a cargo hold. There are 4 creatures.
![[rinn_rix_zaglard.png]]They are gnome squidlings. They are just milling about in the cargo hold. We continue into the ship and meet [[Voren]] who escorts us to [[Dredovex]]. We learned that they are gnomes that are turned into [[ceramorphs]]. Not full fledged mind flayers

We trade the [[psi crystal]] for a [[laser pistol]] and help them with the ship. [[Bael]] and [[Worthy]] help them with repairing the ship. [[Bael]] agrees to have a worm inserted into his ear and begin [[ceromophosis]].

[[Bael]] learns to shoot the [[laser pistol]]. We spend the night in the ship wreck so that [[Bael]] can undergo his transformation. [[Bael]] uses the downtime to document the process of [[ceromophosis]] in great detail.

We take a long rest

We head towards [[Bryn Shander]] to check in on [[Arastra Roh]]. He is fine.

We head to [[Targos]] to confront [[Speaker Tharnel Maxandriar]] about the slaves and [[Obsidian Holdings]]. We head to the town hall.

We kill the guards as they are loyal to [[Naerth]]. We head upstairs and find [[Speaker Tharnel Maxandriar]] and [[Naerth]] speaking to each other.
