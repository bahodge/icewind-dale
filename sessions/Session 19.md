We begin this session on the [[Wyrmdune Crag]]. [[Skam]] starts talking to tribespeople for more information about the town, culture and how we can get the white cloak from [[Ogalia]].

There are tracks where the giant rams are kept and brought to the village. We confirm that [[Ogalia]] is going to attend the meeting tomorrow with only her honor guard. We ask where the white dragon lives and it lived in the north. [[Ogalia]] informs us that there is a visitor in the village and she asks us to heal him.

The guest is an [[aracokra]] named [[Seeki Kari]]. We agree to heal him. There is a shaman with him and who sucks at their job. [[Skam]] examines the patient. His corneas are fucked up. He tells us that he is a messenger for his [[aracokra]] clan. [[Skam]] heals their blindness with lesser restoration. The shaman is jealous.

[[Seeki Kari]] gives us 4 carnelians worth 50gp each and says thank you. We return to the main hall and speak with [[Ogalia]]. [[Skam]] feeds the seeds of doubt by mentioning that the letter is likely related to the impending war. [[Seeki Kari]] says they will keep the payment even if the peace talks go well.

We talk to [[Arceus]]' dad about the obsidian legendary weapons.  There is a horn of blasting entombed with the jarl of jarls. [[Rageryarva]] is the jarl of jarls. Whenever [[Vlagomir]] would use the obsidian greataxe.

We decide to sleep for the night and then go for the [[horn of blasting]]. We set off to speak with [[Jarl Moot]]. We see a semi circular arrangement of seats with ghostly stone giant jarls.

We introduce ourselves and ask for some help in killing the massive white dragon. He agrees and allows us to try and enter his tomb. We defeat the Jarl and we get the [[horn of blasting]] as well as a diamond.

We head to the [[Akaanathi]] clan and try to negotiate with them. We convince them that we are worthy enough to enter the settlement. We speak with [[Arn Rockfist]] and convince him to try for peace with [[Ogalia]] today.

Terms:
- We establish a soup caravan to [[Arn Rockfist]]'s village for the [[gryffin]]
- [[Arn Rockfist]] and [[Ogalia]] must agree to peace
- [[Frozen Assets]] will mediate

We head down to the valley and setup the peace talks. We share and prepare a meal with a delicacy from [[Skytower Shelter]]. [[Skam]] convinces [[Ogalia]] to give up her cloak.

We resolve how the clans would lead
We resolve where the clan would live

As we plan the celebration of we are attacked by the [[aracokra]]. But [[Ogalia]], is able to convince them to leave us. The crisis is averted.

We stay with the unified tribe for 2 days and learn to rid the [[gryffin]]s. We are ready to fly to the island.

Next time:
- We fly to the [[Auril]]'s abode. We will arrive around midnight as she leaves to weave.
- We are looking for anything to help us melt the ice.
- We are looking for the [[Kodasyl of White]]
- We are looking for [[Nass Lantomir]] (she has a weasel familiar)
- We are looking for [[Speaker Tharnel Maxandriar]]'s daughter.
