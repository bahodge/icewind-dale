We begin our session in the throne room with a massive [[chardalyn]] throne. A [[myconid]] is tied to the throne and it is being tortured by some minions. We see [[Zardock]]'s son, [[Dirth]]. [[Dirth]] spots us and we enter combat. We are attacked by some warewolf looking things.

We kill all the [[duergar]] and monsters. [[Dirth]] gets away and we save the [[myconid]] and he gives us a pouch of spores (potion of haste) and a greater potion of health. 

We decide to head towards the door that [[Dirth]] escaped from and gave chase. We head arrive at the forge and enter. [[Arceus]] chugs the potion of speed. There is a massive forge in the center of the room. There are four towers and a platform all occupied by [[duergar]]. There is a hulking [[duergar]] with a black gauntlet and a huge mace. It is [[Zardock]]. [[Deep Duera]] told [[Zardock]] that he should destroy the [[Ten Towns]].

We battle!

We kill [[Dirth]] and [[Zardock]] enrages. We continue to massacre his men. We kill [[Zardock]] but the dragon gets away. We call the [[ceramorphs]] and convince them to help us pursue the dragon using their ship.
