## Recap

- We begin at the [[Northern Light Inn]] in [[Caer Konig]]
## Notes

We send a message to [[Nass Lantomir]] to update her our quests. [[Bael]] crafts some throwing darts for [[Murdoch]]. We identify the two potions and discover that one is a potion of vitality and a potion of resistance. We let [[Nass Lantomir]] know we are headed to a fortress. We head out to the fortress at 7am.

We arrive at the fortress at the bottom of [[Caer Dineval]]. [[Murdoch]] sneaks up to the fortress walls and inspects a watch tower. There is a single creature in the tower walking a circle. There is a dwarven figure in who spots [[Murdoch]]. We are attacked by the guards who are [[duergar]] dwarves. We also are attacked by a [[ogre zombie]]. We also fight a dwarf

We rescue some goats and agree to bring them to them back to [[Caer Konig]]. We find some dark shards of crystal that we believe are [[chardalyn]] that look like the crystals described by the [[Speaker Trovus]].

Upon inspection the [[chardalyn]] crystals are malleable and can be crafted into useful items.

Loot:
- [[chardalyn]] lantern
- a note
- 3 [[chardalyn]] shards emitting demonic energy the size of daggers
- 25 rations
- 150ft of hempen rope
- small sack containing 25 pearls carved into a necklace.
- 3 daggers
- A set of woodcarver's tools
- A set of navigator's tools
- fishing tackle
- potion of healing hidden in a leather pouch
- 73sp
- 2 suits of scale mail
- 2 steel shields
- 3 war picks
- 9 javelins
- 2 climber's kits
- 4 mess kits

[[Bael]] impales the bodies along the road to the fortress as [[Worthy]] writes "only the worthy may enter" on the fortress door. We head back to [[Caer Konig]] to turn in all the quests. We meet with [[Speaker Trovus]] and turn in the lantern and complete the quest. We are given an IOU for a [[yeti]] coat as we complete the [[Caer Konig]] quest. We are given free room and board in [[Caer Konig]]. We are given 1 cask of [[Tej Wine]]
