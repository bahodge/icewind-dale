We begin this session in [[Termalaine]] in the aftermath of the slaver slaughter. Before we leave [[Termalaine]],  [[Auril]] conjures a storm and sends it a [[Ten Towns]]. We decide to still head north to the [[old black cabin]].

We get lost in the storm for a bit and are still able to find the cabin. It looks abandoned. We approach the cabin. The cabin smells charred and like flesh. Lots of broken stuff. There is a mostly incinerated skeleton.

[[Karas]] picks up an object in the house and is incinerated. It also blinds [[Murdoch]]. We examine a charred book with a title on Magi...eril (possibly Magic of the Netherile). It would be a few words, no more than five words. On the skeleton, the amulet is completely unsoiled. It is the symbol of [[Lethander]]. We hear a thud at a side door and investigate. We enter a workshop but all of it is covered in frost.

We continue to search the house and find some wine barrels covered in frost. They are barrels of [[Tej Wine]] from [[Goodmead]]. We continue exploring and enter the bedroom. There are some calligraphers supplies.

We find:
- Calligrapher's supplies
- Smiths kit
- Tinker's kit

[[Murdoch]] touches a scroll and sees this letter.

We wrap the [[Summer Star]] in some blankets and it doesn't kill us. We are able to replicate one of the missing rings with he remaining materials in the workshop. We are able to fix it and [[Bael]] attempts to attune to the [[Summer Star]]. [[Bael]] casts the control weather and clear the blizzard. We are hit with a ray of light and receive the [[blessing of the Morninglord]].

Some searchlights come over the night sky and we are hiding in the cabin. It looks like a creature that is made of light is approaching the cabin. It is a [[cold light walker]] and is accompanied by some [[ice mephites]]

While we were in the woods and stumbling around we found polar bear tracks. We fight and kill the [[cold light walker]] and the [[ice mephites]].

We continue to the [[Netherese]] tower to the east. On our travels there is a heard of deer that is attacked by a [[white dragon]] with a rider atop it. Its den is likely to the west. We ask the deer about the dragon and they tell us all they know. The deer is named [[Elko]].

We cross the rivers and see a rock tower ahead of us. It looks like the rock was thrust into the ground. We do see some people at the base of the structure and approach the camp. We see [[Avarice]] and [[Vellen Harpelle]] both accompanied by some expeditioners with them.

[[Worthy]] sees [[Avarice]] and they confront each other. [[Avarice]] tells her that she hasn't heard from their family and she is singularly consumed with finding [[Netherese]] artifacts for the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].

We spot a tunnel in the ice that would lead into the tower. We convince both [[Vellen Harpelle]] and [[Avarice]] to work together.

Next time
- explore the [[Netherese]] tower.
