We begin the session in [[Termalaine]]. We set out to [[Lonelywood]] in the dim light under the low light and stay on the trail. This region of [[Icewind Dale]] has trees. It isn't as windy and there is a small town nestled on the edge of the lake. We sign ini and see that [[Torg's Caravan]] is also in the log book. We learn that [[Garrett Veloran]] we also learn was signed in. There was a strange man that was part of [[Torg's Caravan]] who was not dressed for the winter with bright cold eyes. They left a few days ago towards the east towards [[Caer Konig]].

We learn more about the [[(completed) white moose menace of lonelywood]] and plan to speak with the speaker [[Nimsy Huddle]]. We head to the Town Hall to speak with [[Nimsy Huddle]]. There is a group of well armed hunters and trappers. The town is so small that it doesn't sell much more than scrimshander.

We head out into the woods to look for the moose. We find some [[chawinga]]s. We hear a scream in the forest. We run to the location and see the hunters who have been killed by a [[banshee]]. We try to ask her how we can help and she tells us that her tomb has been desecrated. It is somewhere in the northern part of the forest. The [[banshee]] is named [[Valen Starshade]]. We agree to help her. We start walking north and stumble across the moose tracks. We follow them and come across a tomb. We start to make a fire and are attacked by a massive moose. We kill moose and return the [[banshee]] to her tomb.

We use a scrying mirror to scry on [[Garrett Veloran]] to gain more insight on the murderer. We scry on [[Torg]]. We see [[Arastra Roh]] in the mirror and they are dressed in the tunic and light clothes with icy eyes. We see [[Avarice]] in a small stone room at a desk studying and dressed in cold weather clothes. We look for [[Naerth]] and see speaker [[Tharnel Maxandriar]] speaking with a tiefling. It shounds like they are in kahoots and hatching some scheme.

We go into the last chamber and find a person. Her name is [[Ravison]]. We kill her and recover another awakened bush. 

Loot:
- two sickles made of ice
- [[packet with letters]] in it
- Decaying body of a twin of [[Ravison]]
- 2 potions in crystal vials

We meet a berry bush that accompanied [[Ravison]]. We learned that [[Ravison]] has awakened. We offer to take it back to the town of [[Lonelywood]].

We head back to the town and loot the bodies of the hunters that were killed by the [[banshee]].

Loot:
- bloodstained clothes
- 3 axes

We went back and knocked on the speaker's door and complete the [[(completed) white moose menace of lonelywood]] quest.

We receive the reward
- 1 deed of the [[White Moose Inn]] in [[Lonelywood]].
- 100gp


We spend the night in speaker [[Nimsy Huddle]]'s attic and level up.

The next morning we have a dog sprint up to us and it looks like [[Garrett Veloran]]'s dog. Before heading out we purchase 2 dogs and 2 sleds for 140gp. We head out towards the east towards [[Kelvin's Caern]].
