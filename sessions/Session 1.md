We open by pushing the iron cart back to [[Bryn Shander]]. We are ambushed on our way back by a giant wild cat called a [[crag cat]]. 

Loot:
- [[crag cat]] pelt

We push the cart to [[Black Iron Blades]] and complete the [[(completed) recover dwarf sled]] quest. We should inform [[Sheriff Markham Southwell]] about the goblins. The sheriff can be found at the town hall which is just to the south of [[Black Iron Blades]]. We might be able to sell the hide at [[Lonelywood]]

Loot:
- 1 gem valued at 50gp in [[Bryn Shander]]
	- the gem has distinctive color bandings

The blacksmith say's that the speaker in [[Targos]] is always offering work to people. We head back to the [[North Look Inn]] and spend the night.

The next day we head to the town hall in search of [[Duvessa Shane]] and [[Sheriff Markham Southwell]]. We speak to secretary and are able to gain an audience with [[Sheriff Markham Southwell]]. We report the [[goblin]] attack and the [[yeti]]. We offer to hunt down the [[goblin]]s but we are likely too weak to fight them. We also report [[ten towns murders]] that [[Hlen Trollbane]] was speaking about. He tells us that [[Dugan's Hole]] is the uncivilized town.

We speak with [[Hlen Trollbane]] and get up to speed on [[ten towns murders]]. We learn that [[Ten Towns]] are sacrificing humans in order to appease [[Auril]] and citizens are trying to bribe their way out of the lottery. We decide to head to [[Targos]] to preempt the murder but speak with [[Nass Lantomir]] before we leave town.

[[Nass Lantomir]] is speaking with the barkeep about wizards in town. There were 3 wizards who were in town and had a falling out and separated. We ask her for money and she we can [[find Nass Lantomir's wizard friends]]. 

We let her know that we are going to [[Targos]] and head out.

We arrive at [[Targos]] and it is a mostly palisades town. We see boats being dragged out on the ice towards the water. We enter the town posing as investigators. They ask us to sign in on their logbook. The town is known for being the original big deal. We learn the speaker's name as [[Tharnel Maxandriar]] who is trying to turn the town into more of a shipping town. We head to speak with [[Tharnel Maxandriar]] at the [[Luskin Arms]].

We meet with [[Tharnel Maxandriar]] about the murders and try to come up with a plan to lure out the murderer. We also let him know that we are looking for work. We decide to head out to [[Bremen]]. We head to [[Three Ships Sailing Tavern]] to beg for food. We see a patron who is rollin in cash wearing a very deep `V` tunic. He tells us that his husband is out of town to [[Kelvin's Caern]]. His name is [[Keagan Velaran]] and is a stay at home husband. We ask about him and if he knows about any monster that lives in [[Maer Dualdon]] but only [[Bremen]] is being terrorized. He tells us that his husband [[Garrett Veloran]].

We head to [[Bremen]] along the side of the lake [[Maer Dualdon]]. 

[[Worthy]] talks to [[Bael]] about [[Avarice]] and she is related. [[Bael]] reveals that he was trained by [[Avarice]].

We get to the mouth of the lake and the river is frozen over. We walk across the solid frozen river and are able to cross it. Ice is slick and we might want to invest in proper shoes. We arrive on the edge of [[Bremen]] and see a figure shambling about. It looks like an elder dwarf. They are shivering and we escort them to town. There is no wooden palisade around the town but there are a lot of fisheries and warehouses. The elderly man is named Speaker [[Dorbolgath]] and the town has been searching for him for days. We head to the inn to warm up the speaker. As we walk up to the facility and the sign says [[Buried Treasures Inn]].

We meet [[Kora Mulphoun]] who runs the [[Buried Treasures Inn]] and are given a free night's stay. She tells us that the speaker [[Dorbolgath]] gets visions and wanders into the wilderness. Her son [[Huwar Mulphoun]] went on the search but came back different. Her son had come back with a shard of black ice. He left town with some tieflings to go to some castle. The ruins of the castle are [[Caer Dineval]] and [[Caer Konig]]. She asks us to [[(completed) find Huwar Mulphoun]].

We go to the docks to find out more about the lake monster. There are two boats and one of them is highly damaged. We prepare the boat to move out the and another person came. Their name is [[Talli]] and he is studying the wildlife of [[Icewind Dale]]. He asks us to not kill the monster.

We ask [[Talli]] to come and join us to study the monster. We head out on the ice. We see a keelboat flying the [[Targos]] flag. They haven't seen the lake monster. [[Worthy]] speaks with the fish the fisherman have in their net and they say they will help us find the monster. We fight the fishermen and they are killed by the fish that were freed.

The lake monster speaks common. We convince the monster to leave the fishermen in peace. We sell the fish barrels to [[Grenski Barrelbore]] and we each gain 160 copper. We convince that [[Talli]] will vouch that the creature is no longer a threat.

We head back to the [[Buried Treasures Inn]]. Speaker [[Dorbolgath]] is well enough to talk. He remembers that [[Bremen]] was known for all the treasures that washed up on the shores. We suggest [[Dorbolgath]] should pass off the leadership.

 Next Time:
- Go to [[Targos]] to turn in the quest.
