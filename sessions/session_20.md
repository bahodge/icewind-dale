We are hanging out in the [[White Moose Inn]] and we are approached by [[Vellen Harpelle]]. She says that [[Nass Lantomir]] stole her [[Professor Skant]] orb. She asks to accompany us and she is going to ride her undead [[grick]]. We purchase equipment.

We head out on our [[gryffin]]s with [[Vellen Harpelle]]. [[Bael]] has begun embracing the [[ceromorph]] powers and gains telepathy.

As we are flying to the island, we see [[Auril]] on her bird.

We see an island that is in the shape a slowflake where the points are facing cardinal directions. We fly up high to survey the land. We decide to land near some of the ships that have run aground. We fly to the northwest side of the island. There is a ship that has run aground and semi submerged. It is a fly a flag from [[Neverwinter]]. We land on the ship and are attacked by some humanoid fish folk called [[marrow]]s. We BATTLE!

We kill all of them and collect a chest. In the chest is
- 400gp
- 800sp
- 4 pieces of jewelry worth 25gp each
On the side of the chest are 3 giant oysters, which we shuck them and get 3 succulent oysters.

We find no signs of life from [[Nass Lantomir]] and we start to search for [[Professor Skant]]. We come across a grizzly scene of carnage of bodies ripped apart. It looks like [[Nass Lantomir]]'s group where they landed but we don't find her body. We continue forward.

Eventually we reach a yawning cave and enter. We see a massive [[yeti]] and we see [[zelenor]].

The orb sees us and there is a floating ghost. The ghost looks like [[Nass Lantomir]].

[[Nass Lantomir]] possesses [[Bael]] and forces him to be completely consumed to find the [[Kodasyl of White]] and the [[Professor Skant]] orb. The [[yeti]] attacks us.

We kill the [[yeti]].
We collect up [[Nass Lantomir]]'s spellbook and [[Bael]] puts it in his pack.

We head up towards the abode. There are ice sculptures that look hyper-realistic. No mortal hand could have created them. We see a frost druid training with the ice sculptures.

We speak with [[Arch Druid Shandra]], the druid that was training outside in the garden and we deceive her that we are there to take the [[Auril]] challenge. We continue to the door. We walk up the stairs.
![[aurils_abode.png]]
We walk up to the citadel up the 600ft mountain. The steps end at a giant double door.

There is a message in dwarvish "grimscale".

Next time:
- Go in abode
- Murder [[Arch Druid Shandra]]
