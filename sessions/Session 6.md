The party has settled on the name the [[Frozen Assets]].

We leave [[Caer Konig]] and head to [[Caer Dineval]] on our nice sled doggoids. The town looks very quaint. We learn the speaker is [[Cranoc Siever]]. He has been missing for a few weeks. There were robed figures who came to town and wouldn't let anyone into the castle. We decide to [[investigate the missing speaker of caer dineval]].

There is a ruined watch tower on the south side. We look at the log book and see that [[Huwar Mulphoun]] has signed in but not signed out. We head to the tavern, [[The Uphill Climb]] to look for some room and board. We mush ahead to the tavern. We smell hot chowder and beer and sprits. There are only 2 people inside. We meet the bartender [[Roark]]. He tells us that we could go try to find a room at the Caer. We order some spirits. The robed people don't drink and haven't visited the tavern.

We learn that [[Caer Dineval]] sacrifices food to the frost druids. The [[crag cat]]s will eat.

We learned that there was another murder in this town. One of the local fishermen was killed. We think that it is related to the [[ten towns murders]]. We decide to talk with the speaker [[Cranoc Siever]]. We buy a bottle of spirits to gift to the speaker. 

We approach the caer and speak with the guards. We try talk our way into the castle. [[Murdoch]] recognizes that they are likely working with a devil [[Levistus]]. [[Murdoch]] shows them our hard [[chardalyn]] shards. They open the portcullis and let us into the caer. We surrender all of our weapons and enter the castle. We enter the courtyard. We ask to speak with the leader of the robed people called [[Kadroth]]. He is located in his office.

All the cultists are wearing pendents like this

We are led to the back right of the caer in a tower where we are told we can sleep. There are a lot of beds in the room. We head over to [[Kadroth]]. There is small child, [[Alisar]] who will be our guide. We learn from [[Alisar]] that [[Huwar Mulphoun]] is at the gate.

We head to the great hall. We spot [[Huwar Mulphoun]] and speak with him and tell him to meet us later. There is a young tiefling servant cleaning up in the hall while the cultists eat. We sit and eat some knucklehead trout filet. We learn that the chef, [[Karo Salafan]], has been the chef for years and loves cooking. We learn that [[Avarice]] is inside the caer in the basement.

We find [[Thube]] to schedule an appointment with [[Kadroth]]. The sitting room looks very nice. [[Kadroth]] sounds like a bitch. There is a red skinned tiefling behind the desk. He seems to have had an agreement with the [[duergar]]. We know that [[Levistus]] is the devil they serve and [[Kadroth]] is kind of mad that we even know. We learn that [[Hethel]] is the only member who still hears [[Levistus]]' words and so does [[Avarice]]. This makes [[Kadroth]] jealous.

We speak with [[Hethel]]. She is a soothsayer and has dreaded this moment (meeting us). We learn that [[Levistus]] has assigned the cult to work with the [[duergar]] to threaten [[Ten Towns]]. The [[duergar]] are building the weapon out of [[chardalyn]] and have built a fortress in the [[Spine of the World]] and a furnace powered by the beating heart of a red dragon. She tells us that [[Levistus]] is using the cult and [[duergar]] to be freed. We should stop them. They received shipments from one of [[Zardock]]'s son. The last shipment is likely coming from [[Easthaven]].

After speaking with her, she dies. We make it seem like we were never there and head into [[Kadroth]]'s bedroom. The cat inside the room is named [[Touche]]. We are unable to find anything other than the cat.

We leave and head towards [[Avarice]] and learn that [[Huwar Mulphoun]] is likely not willingly staying there. We head to the basement. The basement is very chilly. We find 4 bodies, 3 humans and a halfling who were wrapped in sheets. We paddle down a boat and find [[Avarice]]. [[Avarice]] is hanging out with the cultists because they seem useful. She tells us that the cult is named the [[Black Swords]] She takes the [[Netherese]] song and uses it to triangulate the [[Netherese]] city.

We leave and enter the great hall and meet [[Huwar Mulphoun]] and [[Karo Salafan]]. We learn that [[Huwar Mulphoun]] joined after the shard "spoke" to him.

We eat some of the best sauteed knucklehead trout. We hear screaming. The tiefling server finds [[Hethel]]'s body and screams murder. The compound is put into lockdown. Her death is ruled natural causes.

We decide to distract [[Kadroth]] and sneak into the speaker [[Cranoc Siever]]. [[Skam]] and [[Murdoch]] try to deceive the guards in the room and speak. [[Skam]] convinces the guards to leave. They see the speaker is shitting in a pot. [[Skam]] convinces the speaker to leave the castle. We convince him to drink the invisibility potion and escape the castle.

We head to the tavern. The [[Black Swords]] arrived under false pretenses and took over the caer.

We retake the castle and reinstate speaker [[Cranoc Siever]] and [[Avarice]] as being in charge of the [[Caer Dineval]].
