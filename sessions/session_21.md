We begin at the door of the citadel. We open the door as a group effort. We are able to open the door and enter the abode. We enter a long rectangular room that looks like a guard room. There is a withered frost giant leaning on a great axe. The giant is approximately 60ft away. We wave at the giant but there are no reactions. We see a pattern on the ground. [[Bael]] throws some weapons that distract the giant. We try to run across the hallway but are caught by the giant.

We trick him and sneak through the door behind the giant. We find ourselves in a great feast hall. There is a giant table and chairs. Also massive mammoth tusks formed into bugles. We scramble up on top of the table. [[Bael]] shatters the mouthpiece on the bugles and then we go to the kitchen. There is a giant table with storage racks and tankards. There is a tablet with near the cauldron. The tablet looks like a recipe book. We make a [[potion of vitality]]. We also create another [[potion of frost giant strength]]. The frost giant catches back up to us and we fight it. We kill the giant and loot him

- 4400sp
- 7800cp
- 4 gold nipple rings worth 150gp each
- Giant shield made of white dragon scales. Impressive but worthless.
- 2ft tall chipped statuette made of ice weighing 50lbs worth 50gp.
- Jug with a bunch of spouts

We make another [[potion of vitality]]. We also create another potion of hearth's heat [[potion of cold resitance]]. We continue on to another room and happen upon a grand stairwell. We go up the stairwell to a semi circular room.  It is the throne room and we get hurt and it wasn't worth it.

We go to another room and there is a bedchamber. The bedchamber looks like it has been made into a nest. There is someone cowering behind the bed. We find [[Maxin Maxandriar]], daughter of [[Speaker Tharnel Maxandriar]]. We learn that the book is in the basement.

We have to pass the trials to get access to the [[Kodasyl of White]].

The trials are
- cruelty
- endurance
- isolation
- persistence

	- 350gp
	- a ring with a black pearl in a fixture of whirlpool
	- spell scrool
		- it is a spell scroll of mass cure wounds (lvl 6) (given to [[Vellen Harpelle]])

[[Bael]] creates a harness for the eggs out of grappling hooks. We head down to the basement. We arrive in a vaulted chamber. There is a happy walrus sliding on the floor. The walrus shapeshifts into a human and it is [[Arch Druid Shandra]]. We need to do the trials and battle Shandra to prove our worth. We decide to go for the trial of cruelty first.

We enter the trial cruelty

Compassion makes you vulnerable, let cruelty be the knife to keep evil away.

We teleport to a blizzard. We are invited to speak with [[Hrald Valraxon]], king of the bear tribe. There are a bunch of people tied up on their knees. We killed all 4 tied up people. 

--- 
We enter the trial of isolation.

In solitude you can understand and harness your full potential.

We are teleported to a camp of nomads of tiger tribe. They are preparing to overtake the elk tribe for resources. [[Bael]] disappears from the camp. They don't return to the camp. [[Murdoch]] disappears from camp. [[Vellen Harpelle]] disappears from camp. They all come back.

---
We enter the trial of endurance

Exist as long as you can by whatever means you can. only by enduring can you survive your enemies.

We teleport to a nomad camp where. The elk tribe is packing up and we agree to help them.

---
We enter the trial of preservation

Every snowflake is unique and that which is unique must be preserved.

We are teleported to the edge of a camp under clear skies. There are dozens of corpses covered in snowdrift. Vultures pick at the bodies and we shoo them away. The vultures fight us. We kill the vultures and find a kid. We give a tribal leader wolf pelt to the kid which calms him down.

A man challenges the boy and we try to fight in his stead.
