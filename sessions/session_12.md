I missed this session.

Party went to [[Goodmead]] and found out that all of the mead has been stolen. Since it is winter, they helped the town. The team met a [[Arceus]] and he joined the party.

Party went to a cave and killed a [[verbeg]] an [[ogre]] and [[cave bear]]. 

The speaker of [[Goodmead]] was killed previously and a new mayor is being elected. [[Shandar]] is a dwarf related to [[Obsidian Holdings]].
