## Notes

We are headed to the mountain at [[Kelvin's Caern]] using the dogs we purchased at [[Lonelywood]]. It is heavily snowing and visibility is limited. The air is colder. We are able to make it to the bottom of [[Kelvin's Caern]] but not after spending all of [[Skam]]'s bardic inspiration. We followed [[Boy]] up to the entrance of the mountain. We see two tents in the snow. There is an overturned sled. We approach and knock on the tents but they are empty. We see the dogs tied to the sled howling. There are no signs of a scuffle. We give the dogs some food and build them a shelter. We head up the mountain after [[Boy]].

We continue up the mountain. We see some goats and [[Murdoch]] shouts at the goats to scare them off. The goats feel somewhat intimidated and then [[Murdoch]] makes the sound of a [[yeti]]. Further up the mountain we hear a reply from a [[yeti]]. We continue up the mountain. We come to some packed snow and an avalanche buries the party. We finally dig ourselves out and continue up the mountain and find [[Garrett]]. We heal him and are ambushed by some [[crag cat]]s. We kill the [[crag cat]]s but [[Boy]] dies. We learn that the expedition members were taken by a [[yeti]]. We climb up the mountain to try to rescue them but it is very difficult.

We find a cave and enter it. There is a massive [[yeti]] inside of the cave. We fight the [[yeti]]. We find a dead goliath from the expedition. Near his body there is a great axe. We continue in and find a halfling playing with a small, furry baby. [[Bael]] hits the creature with a javelin and it runs away. We find [[Paruli Fishfinger]], the halfling. The [[yeti]] was playing too rough for [[Paruli Fishfinger]].

We continue up the mountain and find an almost frozen tiefling at the summit of the mountain. We look south and see 2 towns on the shore of a frozen lake. The town closest to us, we can see some figures. There are some figures departing the town, walking north. On the southeast side, we see some unusual structures built into the mountain like they are made of some sort of dark stone. We pick up the tiefling and take her back into the cave to warm up. As we are headed down we see a streak of light across the sky with purple arcs coming out of the back of it. It crashes very southwest into the tundra. It crashed into the [[Spine of the World]].

We harvest the 2 [[yeti]]'s. We head down the mountain and go towards [[Caer Konig]]. [[Bael]] has 3 levels of exhaustion. We arrive in town and see that [[Torgs Caravan]] is headed to [[Caer Dineval]]. They left 1 day ago. We go to the [[Frozen North Expeditions]] and it is run by a human. We can buy some dogs, sleds and other expedition gear. We head towards the [[Northern Lights]], the inn. 

[[Garret]] gives us bunch of scrimshaw art and we part ways with him.

We learn that [[Caer Konig]] has been plagued by theives. We should speaker with [[Speaker Trovus]] and we can find him at the [[Northern Lights]]. As we keep walking the people are are not friendly. We meet [[Speaker Torvus]], a silver dragonborn as he is looking for the theives. We think that the theives are humanoids and likely more than one. They are stealing things like brikabrack and family heirlooms. All of the objects are made out of [[chardalin]], a dark ice material. We agree to find the theives in exchange for a yeti pelt reward. [[Caer Dineval]] has a lot of [[chardalin]].

We head to the [[Northern Light]] and we eat dinner. There are some wild accusations of who the theives are. They stole their fancy lantern. There were tracks headed towards the mountain. We spend the the night.

We head towards the north following the tracks of the thieves. We see boot marks and there is likely an ogre. Might be goblins. We head towards the side of the mountain. We come to some blocky stronghold shaped in a cresent shape. There is a large stone double door.
