We leave from [[Caer Dineval]] and head towards [[Easthaven]]. We arrive at [[Easthaven]]. We sign into the logbook and see that [[Torg's Caravan]] is in the town. We head to the center of town to see a public execution. The captain of the militia [[Captain Imdra Arlaggath]]. We learn that the criminal is likely a wizard, it might be [[Dazzan]].

A crowd has gathered in front of the town hall. We see that [[Dazzan]], a human wizard, is prepped to be executed. We speak with [[Captain Imdra Arlaggath]]. The very first murder happened weeks ago. We learn that [[Dazzan]] said he found a strange structure in the ice. It sounds like it might have been [[Netherese]]. He apparently came back with some people who he'd paid to go out into the tundra where he found a tower buried halfway into the snow. She marks it on our map and marks it as east of [[Easthaven]]. We accept the quest, [[find missing fishermen]].

We head to the tavern, the [[Wet Trout]]. The owner is a [[dragonborn]], [[Niemitra]]. We learn that the [[White Lady Inn]]. We walk over and speak with [[Albira]]. We learn that [[Albira]]'s granddaughter's parents were killed by [[gnoll]]s. [[Albira]] points out some good fishing spots. She says we should go to the [[White Lady Inn]] to learn more about the [[White Lady]].

We approach another patron called [[Cython]]. [[Murdoch]] approaches him sexually. [[Cython]] is complaining about the weather. We agree to rent some boats from him.

We go to the [[White Lady Inn]]. We rent some rooms for us and some rooms for our dogs. There is a local bard, [[Renaldo]], is about so do a seance. We join in the ceremony and suck at persuading the [[White Lady]] to come but we suck and end up fighting her. She says that some [[Wailing Caves]] are the source of her befuddlements. It is likely that the fishermen are in the [[Wailing Caves]]. We go to [[Easthaven]] ferry to find the [[duergar]].

We arrive at the docks and observe from a far. We board the boat and search it. We find a map of [[Icewind Dale]] that marks the points of every [[Ten Towns]] settlement. It also marks another location in the [[Spine of the World]] called [[Sunblight Fortress]]. Another by [[Kelvin's Caern]]. The doors slam shut and are ambushed by some [[duergar]]. We fight an incredibly difficult fight.

We loot:
- Cask of mushroom wine
- Map of [[duergar]] locations
- 70gp
- plans to steal a [[chardalyn]] bust from the town hall of [[Easthaven]]

We head to the town hall to look at the [[chardalyn]] bust. We meet up with [[Captain Imdra Arlaggath]] in her office. We find the [[chardalyn bust]] and it is a massive demonic statue. We fight the [[White Lady]] and then go to the [[White Lady Inn]]. We find a new young merchant who is also hearing the annoying noise of machinery. The noise stops and we hear a

> “Nautiloid down. Emergency protocols enabled. Crew safe, but vessel imperiled. Psi crystal needed. Come at once.”

[[Bael]] is attacked by the merchant after he sees the [[psi crystal]]. [[Bael]] chokes him out.
