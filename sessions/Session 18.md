We begin our journey with [[Skam]] again. He says that the [[Zentharum]] are in [[Ten Towns]]. Bastion is located at the [[White Moose Inn]].

We know we need to get across the ocean. So we decide to go to [[Arceus]]' tribe's, the [[Thuunlakalaga]] tribe location to try and get some [[griffen]]s to travel across the ocean. We know that the tribe is competitive and likes to play [[goatball]]. We are looking for the [[Kodasyl of White]].

We head out to [[Skytower Shelter]] to challenge the [[Akaanathi]] clan for the [[griffen]]s. We are intercepted by a patrol of [[griffen]]s and riders and explain our purpose. We tell them we want to speak with the leader [[Arn Rockfist]]. 

We arrive at the village and there are [[griffen]]s flying overhead. The village is inside of a cave. One of the people at the gate yells down at us that we are not welcome here. It is their chieftan [[Arn Rockfist]]. He challenges us to bring him the white cloak of the leader [[Thuunlakalaga]] clan, [[Ogalia]].

Back in the day, during a game of [[goatball]], a child hit a [[griffen]] with a ball. They then snuck up and killed the [[griffen]] which was a big insult. 

We scout out the area and see a lady trying to train a [[griffen]].

[[Worthy]] sneaks up and tries to talk to the big [[griffen]] and startles her. [[Worthy]] tries to negotiate and fails. We leave and agree that we will try to get the white cloak.

We arrive at the [[Thuunlakalaga]] location. We see the bones of a dragon half buried in the snow. Past the remains are tunnels that lead into the mountain. The dragon's name was [[Stegarious]]. We see some [[chawinga]]s dancing on the bones

The [[chawinga]]s brush [[Murdoch]]'s beard with a pinecone and climb him like a mountain.  We see the [[goatball]] players.

We head over and observe the [[goatball]] game. [[Arceus]] sees his adopted father [[Arwani]]. We discuss potentially making trade routes. We observe the game and then go walk to the chief's tent. We continue to the main hall and there are dwarven runes carved into the walls.

The chief spots [[Arceus]] and says that there is another goliath that went meeting [[Kabunka]]. We try to negotiate with [[Ogalia]] to get the white cloak but it isn't going well. We learn that the other side of the story is that a child was attacked by the [[griffen]] and they were forced to kill it. [[Ogalia]] is actually the child that was attacked. We agree that we are going to play [[goatball]] for the cloak.

We play them in [[goatball]] and lose.
