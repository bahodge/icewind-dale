[[Kharas]] and [[Worthy]] join up with the party in [[Easthaven]]. We see the crazy merchant, [[Telvaster]]. He tells us that he is headed south.

We leave the tavern and arrive at [[Torg's Caravan]]. We see a dwarf that we thnink looks interesting. He introduces himself as [[Kharas]]. He joins the group

We see [[Torg]] and [[Arastra Roh]]. He asks like he doesn't even recognize [[Bael]]. We talk with [[Torg]] and he says that [[Arastra Roh]] joined the caravan 2 months ago. We believe that [[Arastra Roh]] now is called [[Sephic Calteroh]]. [[Arastra Roh]] refuses to let us search his sled/tent and pulls an ice sword. [[Kharas]] immediately is fucked up. We knock out [[Arastra Roh]] and tie him up.

We search [[Arastra Roh]] and his sled. We find [[Auril]] paraphernalia. There are trinkets also among his belongings. We report to [[Hlen Trollbane]] that we have captured the murderer. We also find some ice daggers that match.

We speak to [[Captain Imdra Arlaggath]] and keep [[Arastra Roh]] in the brig while we go to the [[Wailing Caves]]. 

We come across the wilderness and approach the [[Wailing Caves]] to find some tracks going in. The tracks look like a large predator tracks. A wolf emerges and [[Worthy]] talks to it. The wolf says that the fishermen might be further in the cave. The wolf says that there are 3 women living in the cave that are keeping the fishermen "company". [[Wolfina]] agrees to join our sled dog team. He also tells us that there is a big scary skeleton in the cave.

We come across a frozen waterfall with some "goodies" behind it. As we break through the ice and are attacked by a watery enemy. [[Bael]] grabs the goodies during combat and both [[Bael]] and [[Murdoch]] are now soaked.

We find an explorer's pack and a miner's pick.

We continue through the cave and kill a giant frost giant skeleton.

We come across 3 women cooking who convince [[Bael]] and [[Murdoch]] to eat some stew. They drop their illusion and reveal that they are [[sea hag]]s. We make a deal with the [[sea hag]]s and are given the [[cauldron of plenty]] and the [[White Lady]]'s treasure (600gp).

We return to [[Easthaven]] and turn in the [[(completed) find missing fishermen]] and receive the the reward. [[Dazzan]]'s belongings
	- a bag of grey cloth
	- a piece of parchment
