We begin this session with th e [[Sunblight Fortress]] entrance as we have already alerted the entire garrison.

[[Drek]] has asked us to rough him up. We are attacked by the garrison.

We kill all of the local guards and begin exploring. We find a map of a [[chardalyn]] dragon and a map of [[Ten Towns]]. [[Bael]] grabs the [[chardalyn]] dragon and a [[naked dwarven flame statuette]] surrounded by [[mind flayer]] skulls. We open a chest and find a lot of gold and some treasure.

We continue down the hall to the dining hall and come upon [[Grendalfa]]. We sign a "G" at her to signify that we are friends. She gives us a bunch of food and we discuss about [[Zardock]] and how we can kill him. She tells us that [[Zardock]]'s clan is much smaller than [[Grendalfa]]. We pull out the small [[chardalyn dragon]] and it is absorbed by [[Grendalfa]]'s psudodragon. We can go downstairs to find [[Zardock]]. 

We decide to go to the basement to confront [[Zardock]]'s monster and his minions. We head down the elevator down to the mines.

As we arrive in the mines we are attacked by a large chitterring insect. ![[chittering_insectoid.png]]

We are also attacked by little rust bugs ![[rust_monster.png]]

We defeat all the dwarves and monsters. We meet [[Ulkan]], a [[Grendalfa]] sympathizer. We continue down to the tunnels towards the throne room. We think that is where the [[myconid]] is being held. We open the stone doors and enter the room. We breath in a bunch of spores.
