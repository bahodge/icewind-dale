We have all found ourselves in [[Luskin]], a city to the north of the [[Sword Coast]] just south of [[Icewind Dale]]. It is expensive to make the journey north and there are many caravans headed north. [[Nass Lantomir]] met with us each individually and we have all individually agreed to join her. 

We arrive at the wagon and start meeting each other. We meet [[Skam]], [[Bael]], [[Worthy]] and [[Murdoch]]. 

It is summer time but it is chillier than we would expect. [[Nass Lantomir]] reintroduces herself and [[zelenor]] her familiar. She is preparing to go to the north to [[Icewind Dale]]. She has companions that went ahead of us and she is trying to catch up. There are rumors that in [[Icewind Dale]] there are [[Netherese]] artifact that have been uncovered. She is headed north to find riches.

She has never been to [[Icewind Dale]]. It is a region in the north and its cold. Apparently it is always nighttime. We are taking the ten roads to the [[Ten Towns]]. She practices divination and believes that we are destined for greatness. We also look like we need the money. We head out to the north. As we are camping at night [[Bael]] notices a ghostly shadows in the night sky. 

We learn that [[Skam]] is motivated by buying land in the north. [[Worthy]] is spending her time volunteering and gaining skills. She is super nervous and a people a pleaser. She goes and checks on the donkeys. [[Murdoch]] is spending his time trying to whittle boats.

We continue for another week and ascend the foothills of the [[Spine of the World]]. It is very cold and uncomfortable. Eventually we reach the highest part of the pass and to the north all we see is pitch dark night but to the south it is still day time. We continue on into the darkness.

We light our torches and continue down the mountain path into the perpetual dark. We cannot really see anything further than. During the night, [[Bael]] sees a massive white bird with a figure on its back. It leaves a shimmering aurora as it paints the sky. It is gargantuan and the person on it's back is about medium sized. It keeps flying until around 10am as the sun rises. Twilight rises in the morning. [[Bael]] tries to draw a picture of the creature so he can ask about it later when we get to the towns.

The caravan ahead of us is shield dwarves. We learn more about [[Skam]] and he hasn't always been in real estate. The leader of the temple of [[Wakeen]] told [[Skam]] to go north. 

Everything around is snowy and frozen. There are people that have already run out of rations or were not prepared for the cold. We go hunting and donate rations. We donate rations to a caravan of gnomes headed to [[Goodmead]] who are brewers. We learn that they keep bee inside. They give us a small keg of mead that they didn't like. The town speaker is named [[Kendrick Rielsbarrow]]. We also learn the name of one of the gnomes. She is named [[Jennybell]]. [[Skam]] goes hunting the next day and kills a rabbit with vicious mockery. EMOTIONAL DAMAGE! He donates the rabbit to the gnomes.

We continue on towards [[Bryn Shander]], one of the larger of the 10 towns. The weather begins turning and the sky white and we are trapped in a massive blizzard. The blizzard is so thick that we can't see more than 15ft in front of us. As we are coming up with a plan, we hear blood curdling screams.A massive [[yeti]] emerges from the snow and obliterates the dwarf wagon ahead of us. The gnomes behind us are obliterated as well. [[Nass Lantomir]] casts shatter and causes a massive avalanche barrels towards us.

[[Skam]] accompanies [[Nass Lantomir]] and dimension doors out of the blizzard. [[Worthy]], [[Murdoch]] and [[Bael]] are trapped in the snow. [[Skam]] and [[Nass Lantomir]] search for people and help them come out of the snow. We are able to climb out of the snow and save the animals as well. In total there 13 survivors including us.

We continue traveling to the north. We trudge through the snow with only the gear we have on us.

We eventually arrive at the gates of [[Bryn Shander]] at 3 in the afternoon. They ask us to sign their book in order to enter the town. We are pointed to the [[North Look Inn]]. We arrived on the southern side of the town. We all decide to head to the [[North Look Inn]] on the northern side of the town. The town is approximately half a mile wide. There are not that many people.

We enter the [[North Look Inn]] and tavern and are greeted by the proprietor [[Scramsax]]. [[Nass Lantomir]] pays for our room and board. We mentioned that we were looking for work and were pointed to a group of dwarves in the tavern. The dwarves are dressed like the dead dwarves from the caravan. There is another 30 year old person writing a book in the corner. There is a scraggly old man in the corner and another man with a cute little ram.

We learn that it gets dark very early. People generally eat and sleep very early because of how dark it is. Some people think [[Auril]] the god caused it. We ask if the giant white bird was and he [[Scramsax]] tells us the bird does that every night. There is likely no correlation between them. The speaker of [[Bryn Shander]] is [[Duvessa Shane]]

[[Bael]] speaks with [[Caska Lane]] who is writing a mystery novel about a series of murders across the [[Ten Towns]]. She says that there are some murders happening in the [[Ten Towns]]. She was talking with [[Hlen Trollbane]] who claimed there was a murder in [[Hillhaven]] and another here in [[Bryn Shander]]. [[Hlen Trollbane]] is trying to get a meeting with [[Duvessa Shane]].

[[Worthy]] and [[Murdoch]] speak with [[Hruna]], [[Korex]] and [[Sthorm]] who are the dwarves that are in the inn. They inform them that their dwarven caravan was killed in the avalanche attack of the [[yeti]].  The dwarves give us the [[(completed) recover dwarf sled]] quest.

A small ram knocks over another patron's drink and [[Arton]] buys that patron a drink as recompense. The ram is named [[Butter]]. He tells us he is headed to a wedding in [[Easthaven]]. From [[Bryn Shander]] to [[Easthaven]] it is about 7.5 hours to walk there. We tell him that we might see him there in [[Easthaven]].

[[Worthy]] buys the old scraggly man a drink. He says he has a treasure map for sale and [[Skam]] and [[Worthy]] purchase it from him.

We rest for the night.

We head out to [[Black Iron Blades]]. [[Nass Lantomir]] gives us 10gp for supplies. We purchase snowshoes and rations. We purchase a [[Map of Ten Towns]].

We head out towards the location the dwarves described where the sled north of [[Bryn Shander]]. We see a frozen dismembered corpse. We search the corpse and find a pair of scrimshaw cuff links with an image of a boat carved in them. We follow the tracks of sled. We go over another hill and see some creatures. They look like [[goblin]]s. [[Worthy]] calls out "that doesn't belong to you!" and we attack them.

[[Worthy]] is knocked down and we manage to separate the iron sled from [[goblin]]s.

Next time
- turn in the sled
- take a short rest
- heal worthy
