We continue fighting [[Naerth]] and his guards in the warf in [[Targos]]. [[Naerth]] starts ejecting people in cages into the river. The party tries to cut off [[Naerth]]'s escape. We beat the hell out of [[Naerth]] and the dwarves and capture [[Naerth]]. We save all the people in the cages.

We interrogate [[Naerth]] and the [[duergar]] dwarf, [[Bruvo]]. We learn that the [[duergar]] are about to destroy [[Ten Towns]]. [[Worthy]]'s patron visits us and tells us to destroy the [[duergar]]. [[Worthy]]'s patron is a firey horned demon man.

We all level up to level 5.

We head to [[Bryn Shander]] with all of the speakers for a big speaker meeting. As we wait for the meeting we purchase equipment. We go to the meeting, [[Speaker Duvessa Shane]] congratulates us. We learn that the [[White Moose Inn]] is now in working order. We can now use it as a bastion.

[[Naerth]] will be sent to [[Revell's End]]. [[Bruvo]] will be executed later.

We head to the [[Sunblight Fortress]] in the south after the meeting. We climb a massive mountain and see a massive wall. ![[large_stone_wall.png]]

[[Worthy]] flies to the top of the fortress and there are some crates/machinery and [[duergar]] guards. We decide to climb up the the zigzag with [[Worthy]] flying on guard in the sky. We approach the doors. We teleport into the slit. The invisible [[duergar]] asks if we are here to kill [[Zardock]]. We say yes and we let him the rest of the team in. He tells us he is [[Drek]] and if we are captured we should speak with [[Grendalfa]].

We prepare for the entire garrison to attack us due to the noise.

Next Time
- [[Murdoch]] needs to be let in.
- [[Bael]] is opening the doors
- [[Arceus]] is going to defend us
- [[Worthy]] is ready to throw ink on all the invisible folks
